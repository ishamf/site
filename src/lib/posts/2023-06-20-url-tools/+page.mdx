  A tool to generate URLs with complex parameters. It can also be used to generate and open deep links and generate QR codes.

Construct URLs with recursive parameters,

1. Enter some initial URL.
2. Add query parameters.
3. If the parameter value is a valid URL, you'll be able to add params to it.

<script lang="ts">
	import URLTool from './URLTool.svelte'; import {browser} from '$app/environment';
</script>

{#if browser}

<URLTool />

{:else}

<p>Loading URL tool...</p>

{/if}

In my work, sometimes I need to construct complicated URLs with multiple parameters,
and those parameters can be URLs with their own parameters.
There's not really a lot of tools to support this, so I usually have to do the encoding and formatting manually.

Since it seems easy enough to implement, I decided to create one as a post here. I also added a few helpful features.

### Opening as URL

In mobile, copy-pasting the URL in the browser and clicking a link can have different behavior, depending on which app is registered.
So I added a link to test this case.

### Generating QR Code

Another common case is to generate QR code for a URL. It's a simple library import to implement.

### Sharing a URL to this Page

Sometimes you intend for other people to open the URL. In that case, you can share a link to this page.
